Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to generate a student username and password, or to transform an english word to pig latin. 

Inputs: 
- Perform another calculation (y/n) --> (for entire program, and individual functions)
- Type of program
- exit program
- english word (for pig latin)
- student's first, middle, and last name + parent phone number (user/password generator)

Expected Output: 
- Username and password generator:
- - Should generate a username and password for students based on their first middle and last names + parent phone number (per assignment instructions)
- Pig latin converter:
- - Should transform an english word to pig latin (as per assignment instructions)

Types of execution: 
- Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired.
- Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom.
- Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes.
- Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program.

Possible Improvements: 
- Making the program better equipped to handle errors and exceptions (ex. like if the english word has the first 3 letters as vowels).
- Making it less caps sensitive for while loops and if/else statements
